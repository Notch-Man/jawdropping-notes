## Usage/Documentation

### Add a Note

To add a note, click on the `Add A Note` card present on the right side of the window.

After you press it, you will see a modal centered on the screen. Add title, description and tags (please note that tags are space separated) from there.

Choose a color (Light, Primary, Secondary, Success, Danger, Warning, Info, Dark), default is Light, and press the `Add` button or `Cancel` if you don't want to add a note.

### Deleting a Note

Click on a note to delete it.

### Advanced

#### Adding Markdown

You can add markdown by putting using its syntax in the Description field.

#### Using HTML

If you want, you can add custom HTML and use `Bootstrap 5.2` classes & utilities.
But, there will be some layout issues (with images, etc...) as it is only designed for Markdown.

**PS**: Please DO NOT use this as your primary notes app! I made this for learning purposes only and that's that.
If you want to check it out, you're free to do so.
